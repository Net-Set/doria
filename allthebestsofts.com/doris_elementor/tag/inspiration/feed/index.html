										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whoever said “It’s not about the destination. It’s the journey” never flew on a long haul flight. Those flights can be painful, tiresome, jet-lagging, and not to mention absolutely boring despite whatever Disney movie is playing above you on the TV screen. As someone who has flown from Europe to the USA countless times, I’ve picked up some tips and tricks on flying long haul. Here are my tips.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" src="https://atbs.bk-ninja.com/suga/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viviana-rishe-5a5GnXfZSzE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" /></p>
<h4 id="eaa7" class="xn xo am be bd fa xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz">Bring a scarf or jacket.</h4>
<p id="884e" class="wz xa am be xb b xc ya xe yb xg yc xi yd xk ye xm" data-selectable-paragraph="">A scarf especially can act as a blanket or pillow during your long haul flight. Nowadays it’s becoming less common to have a blanket included on your flight, and sometimes the cabin doesn’t even have enough for everyone. The best advice is to bring something functional just in case because flights can get quite chilly. A relatively thick, large scarf will almost always do the job.</p>
<h4 id="21a3" class="xn xo am be bd fa xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz">Pack a memory foam neck pillow.</h4>
<p id="8f5b" class="wz xa am be xb b xc ya xe yb xg yc xi yd xk ye xm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once again, you want to be comfortable on your flight and no matter if you’re in the window, aisle, or middle seat, a memory foam neck pillow will make it all the more comfortable and relaxing for you.</p>
<p id="26fc" class="wz xa am be xb b xc xd xe xf xg xh xi xj xk xl xm" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="xb yf">Tip:</strong> Some people are hesitant to pack a neck pillow because of space. But most neck pillows have a snap closure, meaning you can easily snap it onto your carry on handle or strap it to your personal item. When it doubt, you can always wear it around your neck. No shame.</p>
<h4 id="5a3f" class="xn xo am be bd fa xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz">Bring an eye mask for sleeping.</h4>
<p id="21bb" class="wz xa am be xb b xc ya xe yb xg yc xi yd xk ye xm" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you’re flying through the day, an eye mask will be extremely helpful in getting some <em class="yg">relatively</em> normal shut-eye. If you’re flying on a red eye flight, it’s less necessary, but honestly every little bit helps.</p>
<h4 id="62ff" class="xn xo am be bd fa xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz">Put headphones and a portable charger in your personal item.</h4>
<p id="b6a4" class="wz xa am be xb b xc ya xe yb xg yc xi yd xk ye xm" data-selectable-paragraph="">This one is crucial for keeping yourself entertained or productive. Headphones for jamming or listening to podcasts and a portable charger for keeping your mobile devices charged. Sometime flights have the USB port, but you can’t always count on them to be functioning… Yes, I’m serious. Pack headphones, a portable charger, and your cord just in case.</p>
<h4 id="f452" class="xn xo am be bd fa xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz">Download podcasts.</h4>
<p id="41c2" class="wz xa am be xb b xc ya xe yb xg yc xi yd xk ye xm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Fun, educational entertainment! Podcasts have become one of my favorite pastimes for flying. I just download a few interesting ones before my flight and enjoy them while I’m on board.</p>
<p id="8e92" class="wz xa am be xb b xc xd xe xf xg xh xi xj xk xl xm" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="xb yf">Pro Traveler Tip:</strong> If you’re traveling somewhere new, I love listening to podcasts about that country or location to start getting inspired and excited about my adventure. You could even download a couple of podcasts that teach you some essential words or phrases in your destination country, too!</p>
